# OBJECTIVE 🏅

The project challenge was based on the creation of an interactive web application, putting into practice the fundamentals of
programming and the use of React as a library.

# PREPARATION ⚙️

1. Review the requirements established for the delivery of the project.
2. Download the resources for the creation of the project.
3. I created a "kanban" board to better organize myself and have control over the timing of each part of the project. (Although it is very helpful
at the beginning, there were things that were logically resolved or modified over the course of the project)
4. I prepared a REACT environment locally and gave the initial styles.

I decided to use CSS Modules because it seemed like an organized way to manage the styles.

# DEVELOPMENT 👨🏽‍💻

- It is made up of three main components: < Header /> , < Filters /> and < List />.
- It is < Header /> where the title and the filters that are applied in < Filters /> are rendered in natural language.
- In < Filters /> are each of the filters that can be applied according to different criteria. Each of them is an INPUT whose state is managed through REACT.
- Finally, in < List /> we will find the list of hotels that are instantiated dynamically as the filters are applied or "un-applied".
If there is nothing compatible with the applied filters, the corresponding message will be displayed.

# DIFFICULTIES 📕

The "prop drilling" technique for state management can become somewhat complicated in larger projects.

# CONCLUSION 📃

▶︎ First, solving all the functionality is best. Finally, concentrate on configuring the styles.
